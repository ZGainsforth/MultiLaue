I know of 2) beryllium 12.5 um and 3) 350 um. The others will need to be measured.

Hi Nobu,

I need to know a few things about the XRF detector so I can compute fluorescence more accurately.  Do you know:

1) Sample detector distance?  (It looks like 65 mm but I can’t see where the actual chip is because it is behind the protective window.)
2) What is the detector window composition and thickness?
3) What is the thickness of the Si chip (This is a silicon drift detector, right?)
4) What is the takeoff angle?  (angle between the sample surface normal and the detector)

Thanks!

Zack
