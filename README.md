#MultiLaue
====================

MultiLaue is a software for processing MultiLaue XRD data sets.  Read the [paper](https://github.com/ZGainsforth/MultiLaue/blob/master/2016%20-%20M%26M%20-%20MultiLaue.pdf) here.

By acquiring Laue XRD patterns through a series of filters, it is possible to compute the d-spacing of each reflection. 

1) Read in monochromatic, Laue, or MultiLaue datasets.

2) Compute d-spacings from multiLaue datasets.

3) Compute topographs from mono, Laue and multiLaue datasets.

Is there a feature that would be very useful to you?  Contact me at xraysoftware@ssl.berkeley.edu.

##Todo:
====================

1) Detector sensitivity curve

2) Calibrate filter properties based on standard crystal.

3) Make a a quick overview video of what the program does.
